      "rate:1 -     My co-workers and I placed an order for delivery today from store #691 or maryland pkwy.  We were completely dissatisfied.  We placed our order online at approximately 12:45 with a promise delivery time of 1:30.  After about 3 minutes we received a phone call asking would it be ok for our delivery time to be between 2 and 2:15.  We agreed to the revised time.  At approximately 2:35 we called the store to inquire what was taking so long.  We were told that the food was on the way and that there was no estimated time of arrival.  Totally unprofessional!  We then called a second time at 3:15 and spoke to the assistant manager who informed us the delivery was 2 minutes away.  When we finally received our food it was cold.  This is very unprofessional and unacceptable!  The avocado on the turkey sandwich had begun to turn brown and the bread on the muffaletta was soggy from sitting so long.  The manager didn't even have the decency to offer us any type of compensation for our troubles or a simple apology.  We would greatly appreciate a response and an explanation for our troubles.\n",
      "rate:4 -     I was pleasantly surprised to eat at this buffet in the Orleans Hotel and casino. It was moderately priced not much of a long wait and really, really decent.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went for breakfast, primarily. I enjoyed the really crispy bacon, the scrambled eggs we're perfectly scrambled and fluffy. I also enjoyed the buttermilk pancakes. I've been to buffets in Vegas such as Caesars Palace, the Bellagio, Winn, Harrah's, The Flamingo, Rio, pH, etc. This one was nearly half the cost and was about as good as most. Nothing fancy but good and satisfying.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service, on the other hand, was very lacking and almost non-existent. I basically got up and got my own coffee and tipped accordingly.\n",

      "rate:2 -     At first sight, this buffet was everything I could dream of, but that quickly turned to disappointment. There were a lot of stations with different types of cuisine like Mexican, American, Chinese, and Italian, and I tried all of them.  The problem was that while they all looked great at their stations, as soon as they were back at our table, they were cold and dry. I did admire their selection and stuff myself with food. I just wish it would have tasted as good as it looked.\n",
      "rate:3 -     Been here many times over the past decades. It's huge with tons of options. It used to be one of the best places to chow down with family and friends. The quality has slipped a bit and the lines have declined. \n",

Service was friendly and prompt.  My order of kitfo and gomen was excellent.  I like my food spicy and they met my expectations.  My wife opted for their fish selection, flavored mildly, and it was well prepared.  I brought my own wine and offered to pay a corkage fee.  They let me do so, but asked me in future not to bring my wine, but order theirs.  I am picky about wines, so I probably will not return for that reason, especially since there was no Ethiopian honey wine on the menu as an option.  Parking is easy and the price is very reasonable.  I rate this restaurant as average as compared to other restaurants of this type that we frequent in other cities.\n",
